# Woodplane
A component based Wordpress starter theme based on Timber and Gulp.

## Requirements
Node 
Composer
A Local Wordpress Instance (since this is only the theme)

## Getting started
1. Install Node and nvm. Then run `nvm use` to use the right Node version for this setup.
2. Run `brew install composer` if composer is not yet installed on your Mac.
3. Run `composer install`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `gulp` or `npm run start` to start the dev server.

## Notes

1. You could use Firewheel Local to run a local instance of Wordpress. This is just the theme.
2. Even though this setup works quite well, the Gulp part is kinda old and will be replaced soon. To have livereloading in the browser, you need to install Livereload extension for now.
